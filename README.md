# Communicable Disease Analysis Across California Counties
This repository contains Python code for building and analyzing rate prediction models using previous data as well as user interactive database querying.
## Features
1. Reading data from a CSV file.
2. Data cleaning and data insertion.
3. Data transformation:
   - Rate predicting using the ARIMA model.
   - Rate predicting using a Linear Regression model.
   - Rate predicting using a baseline model.
4. Database for querying about top diseases, case counts, and more.
5. Web scraping for Wikipedia links for each disease.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used:
   * pandas
   * scipy.stats
   * sklearn.metrics
   * matplotlib.pyplot
   * numpy
   * pmdarima
   * sklearn.preprocessing
   * sklearn.linear_model
   * sklearn.model_selection
   * sqlite3
   * requests
   * bs4
     
## Getting Started
